# Fundevogel book recommendations

## What
This project serves as an example workflow for collecting information from [CSV files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), powered by [`pcbis2pdf`](https://github.com/fundevogel/pcbis2pdf).


## Why
In the future this repository should house our [lists of recommendations](https://fundevogel.de/en/recommendations) (~ 300 books), which get published biannually.
