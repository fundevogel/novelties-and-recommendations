# Fundevogel book recommendations

## What
This project serves as an example workflow for collecting information from [CSV files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), exported from [pcbis.de](https://pcbis.de), and gathering some more through wholesale book distributor [KNV](http://knv.de)'s API (with built-in [GoogleBooks API](https://developers.google.com/books) support). For the documentation on their [WSDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language) interface, see [here](http://www.knv.de/fileadmin/user_upload/IT/KNV-Webservice-2.pdf).


## Why
In the future and with the help of pcbis2pdf this repository should house our [lists of recommendations](https://fundevogel.de/en/recommendations) (~ 100 books), which get published biannually.
